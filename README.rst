All code are abandoned.

 `Upstream <https://github.com/gnome-terminator/terminator>`_ has been ported to py3/gtk3 by themselves.

 I already use `st <https://st.suckless.org/>`_ + `tmux <https://tmux.github.io/>`_ to take place of gnome-terminator as terminal emulator.

 All works here has no worth.
